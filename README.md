# Isentropic Flow Properties for Gas Tables
Isentropic flow property relations are derived and using them in this code. 
The following link will take you to the file with Equations used in the code.

Check the above file for any furthur clarification.
The MATLAB Code computes the Isentropic flow property relations and prints the output in two forms.
'Isentropic flow properties.txt' is the text file which can be used as handbook.
'Isentropic properties Table.txt' is the text file which can be used as input data file for a computer code.
Graphical interpretation of the data is also made to compare the results.
 Note: The given files are made for gamma = 1.4
