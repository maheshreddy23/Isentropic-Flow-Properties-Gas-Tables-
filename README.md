# Isentropic-Flow-Properties-Gas-Tables-
This is done using MATLAB. For different values of Ratio of Specific Heat constant generates a table that contains the information about various Isentropic flow property ratios .  It also generates graphs showing the variation of flow properties for a range of Mach Numbers
